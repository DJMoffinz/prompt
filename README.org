#+title: bash prompt (name wip)
i found that startship had a lot of text rendering errors, so i stopped using it, though it's probably my fault

then i found [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/11107564][this]]

and did it

and i made this script and put it in ~/bin/

should be fully portable

and much more customisable than starship anyway
